(** [Short_paths_graph] is a representation of the environment (via the type
    [Graph.t]) that is more suitable to answer short path queries.

    The only structures shared with the typechecker are [Ident.t] and [Path.t].
    [Graph.t] is pure and doesn't hook into the [Env.t].
    Context has to be rebuilt by outside code using [Graph.add].

    For each item (a type, a class type, a module or a module type) the graph can:
    - lookup its definition from a path
    - resolve it to its canonical definition (following all aliases)
    - keep track of its origin (which modules were involved in its definition)
    - tell whether it is shadowed or not in a given context

    These functionalities alone do not give a short path, but they help
    computing it efficiently.

    [Age].

(** Diff and rebase.

    Environments (Env.t) are made of two parts: basis (a set of global modules)
    and local definitions.

    Modules in the basis are loaded on demand. When a [Graph.t] is made from an
    [Env.t], the current basis is used.

    Since the graph is pure, the [Env.t] and the graph will get out of sync as
    new modules are loaded. This is solved using [Diff.t] and [Graph.rebase]:
    - the [Graph.t] made from the initial environment is remembered
    - local definitions are made by extending the graph with [Graph.add]
    - updates to the basis are introduced with [Graph.add] starting again from
      the initial graph, which also produces a [Diff.t]
    - these differences can be injected into the extended [Graph.t] by using
      [Graph.rebase] to replay a set of [Diff.t]

    The main difference between a [Graph.rebase]/[Diff.t] and just adding
    everything on top with [Graph.add] is that shadowing is taken into account.
    [Graph.rebase] will insert definitions at the right point in "time".
